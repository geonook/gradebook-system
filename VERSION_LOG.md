**Session Summary:**
- 🔍 Investigated Progress Audit showing 0 teachers analyzed despite finding 57 teachers
- 🎯 Identified root cause: File naming format mismatch between creation and search
- 📝 Documented JavaScript errors in Web App (duplicate doGet functions)
- 🔄 Multiple version resets to maintain stable base

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Master Data extraction works (57 teachers found correctly)
- ❌ File search fails due to naming pattern mismatch:
  - Creation format: `2526F1_Ms. Wendy_LT_Gradebook` (with semester prefix)
  - Search format: `Ms. Wendy LT Gradebook` (without semester prefix)
- ❌ Web App has JavaScript errors from duplicate doGet functions
- ⚠️ Teacher gradebook files may not exist yet (need batchCreateGradebooks)

**Attempted Solutions** (reverted):
- Enhanced findTeacherGradebookByName with semester prefix matching
- Removed duplicate doGet function definitions
- Added error handling and debugging to dashboard.html

**Current Status:**
- System reverted to stable version b7c6c35
- Progress Audit issue remains unresolved
- Ready for fresh approach in next session
