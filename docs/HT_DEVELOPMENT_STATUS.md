## ⚠️ **PENDING IMPLEMENTATION | 待實作功能**

### 🔧 **High Priority | 高優先級**

#### **1. Sync Function Physical Operations | 同步功能實際操作**
- [ ] `getAssessmentTitlesFromHTGradebook()` - Read titles from HT gradebook sheets
- [ ] `findTeacherGradebooksByGradeGroup()` - Locate target teacher gradebooks
- [ ] `applyAssessmentTitlesToGradebook()` - Write titles to teacher gradebooks
- [ ] Handle Google Sheets API operations for reading/writing assessment titles

**Implementation Notes:**
- Need to parse HT Assessment Management sheet structure
- Extract assessment titles from specific grade/level sections
- Update corresponding columns in teacher gradebooks
- Maintain data integrity during bulk operations

#### **2. HT Dashboard Integration | HT控制台整合**
- [ ] Connect `dashboard_for_HT.html` with actual gradebook data
- [ ] Implement gradebook loading and management functions
- [ ] Add progress tracking for HT-managed teachers
- [ ] Real-time sync status monitoring

#### **3. Assessment Title Storage System | 評量標題儲存系統**
- [ ] Define standard assessment title data structure
- [ ] Implement version control for assessment title changes
- [ ] Add rollback functionality for sync operations
- [ ] Create assessment title change audit log

### 🔧 **Medium Priority | 中優先級**

#### **4. Enhanced User Experience | 增強用戶體驗**
- [ ] Add sync progress indicators and status messages
- [ ] Implement batch sync confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Create visual feedback for successful/failed operations
- [ ] Add undo functionality for recent sync operations

#### **5. System Integration | 系統整合**
- [ ] Integrate with existing progress tracking system
- [ ] Connect HT functions with main dashboard analytics
- [ ] Add HT operations to system monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create HT-specific reporting features

#### **6. Advanced Features | 進階功能**
- [ ] Scheduled automatic sync operations
- [ ] Assessment title template management
- [ ] Bulk import/export of assessment titles
- [ ] Multi-semester assessment title history

### 🔧 **Low Priority | 低優先級**

#### **7. Performance Optimization | 性能優化**
- [ ] Optimize sync operations for large numbers of gradebooks
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed assessment titles
- [ ] Add background processing for batch operations
- [ ] Performance monitoring and bottleneck analysis

#### **8. Advanced Security | 進階安全**
- [ ] Add detailed audit logs for all HT operations
- [ ] Implement session-based permission caching
- [ ] Add IP-based access restrictions
- [ ] Create security incident notification system

## 🚧 **CURRENT PLACEHOLDERS | 當前佔位符**

The following functions contain placeholder implementations and need completion:

```javascript
// ❌ PLACEHOLDER - Needs actual implementation
function getAssessmentTitlesFromHTGradebook(gradebookName, gradeGroup) {
  // Currently returns: { message: 'Assessment title reading not yet implemented' }
}

// ❌ PLACEHOLDER - Needs actual implementation  
function findTeacherGradebooksByGradeGroup(gradeGroup, htType) {
  // Currently returns: []
}

// ❌ PLACEHOLDER - Needs actual implementation
function applyAssessmentTitlesToGradebook(gradebookName, assessmentTitles) {
  // Currently logs: 'Applying assessment titles to ${gradebookName}'
}
```

## 📋 **TESTING CHECKLIST | 測試檢查清單**

### ✅ **Completed Tests | 已完成測試**
- [x] HT gradebook creation with correct file naming
- [x] Permission validation system functionality
- [x] HT Assessment Management sheet generation
- [x] File name pattern recognition

### 🔄 **Pending Tests | 待測試項目**
- [ ] End-to-end sync operation testing
- [ ] Permission denied scenario validation
- [ ] Cross-grade-group access attempt blocking
- [ ] Large-scale sync performance testing
- [ ] Error recovery and rollback testing

## 🎯 **NEXT DEVELOPMENT PHASE | 下一開發階段**

### **Phase 1: Core Sync Implementation (Priority: CRITICAL)**
1. Implement actual Google Sheets reading/writing operations
2. Complete the three placeholder functions
3. Test sync operations with real gradebook data
4. Validate data integrity after sync operations

### **Phase 2: Dashboard Integration (Priority: HIGH)**
1. Connect HT dashboard with real data
2. Add progress monitoring and status displays
3. Implement user-friendly sync interfaces
4. Add error handling and user feedback

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Priority: MEDIUM)**
1. Add audit logging and change tracking
2. Implement advanced sync options
3. Create reporting and analytics features
4. Optimize performance for production use

## 📚 **TECHNICAL DEBT | 技術債務**

1. **Placeholder Functions**: Three critical sync functions need implementation
2. **Error Handling**: Need more comprehensive error scenarios coverage
3. **Performance**: No optimization for large-scale operations yet
4. **Documentation**: API documentation for sync functions needed
5. **Testing**: Automated testing suite for HT operations required

---

## 🔗 **DEPENDENCIES | 依賴關係**

- **Google Apps Script Platform**: All sync operations depend on GAS API limits
- **Google Sheets API**: Reading/writing operations constrained by API quotas
- **Master Data Structure**: HT system relies on consistent Master Data format
- **File Naming Convention**: Critical for HT permission system functionality
- **Test Data Integrity**: Requires consistent 6-HT structure for testing
