=== GOOGLE APPS SCRIPT PUBLIC DEPLOYMENT GUIDANCE ===

To make your Google Apps Script app publicly accessible for testing:

1. 📝 In Google Apps Script Editor:
   - Go to Deploy > New deployment
   - Type: Web app
   - Execute as: Me (your-email@gmail.com)
   - Who has access: Anyone (or Anyone, even anonymous)
   - Click Deploy

2. 🔧 Alternative Method:
   - In the script editor, go to Resources > Cloud Platform project
   - Set up OAuth consent screen
   - Add test users if needed

3. 🚀 For Testing with Playwright:
   - Use the deployment URL from step 1
   - Or implement OAuth2 authentication flow
   - Or use a service account

4. 🛠️ Current Status Analysis:
   - Your app is deployed but requires authentication
   - The URL redirects to Google sign-in
   - This is the default security behavior

5. 📋 Recommended Actions:
   - Redeploy with "Anyone" access if safe for testing
   - Or implement authentication flow in tests
   - Or use environment-specific test endpoints
